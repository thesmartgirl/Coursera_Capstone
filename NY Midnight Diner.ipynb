The show focuses on a midnight diner, the chef, known only as \"The Master\", and his involvement with his customers.\n\nThe setting of Midnight Diner is a small 12 seat Izakaya called \"Meshiya\" in Shinjuku, Tokyo. Despite the restaurant's strange opening hours, 12 am to 7 am, it is popular with the busy nightlife of Shinjuku. The Shinjuku setting, and the hours of operation, means that much of the Midnight Diner story takes place at night.\n\nThe show was well received when it started streaming on Netflix. It has an IMDB rating of 8.4.\n\nThe popularity of the show inspired one business man to open a midnight diner in New York. This report aims to find the best location for such a diner. The selected location must be in a neighborhood with active night life scene, and maybe with some asian culture influences.\n\n"
